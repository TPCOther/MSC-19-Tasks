- php composer
- python 2/3

## Usage

3. Visit <code>[host]/cal.html?id=[STUID]</code>

## Notifications
1. Never put this project onto a factory environment! It's written without necessary secruity measures to prevent injections.
2. Running this project needs to use function <code>system()</code>, if not working, check if system() is blocked. (It should be blocked, please leave it blocked as possible)
3. Due to my laziness, the password is transported **without classification**. Don't use this website in an unsafe environment.
4. If possible, **NEVER RUN IT**.
